INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
To run this script you have several options:
1. Open the source code in py format, create a.py file, run it in the command console or in a compiler.
2. Download the 4MB executable and run it. For obvious reasons, your computer will probably recognize the file as a malicious file since it is a file of 'unknown' origin, so you can always do the first option if you are not sure about it.

REASON FOR THE PROGRAM
--------------------------
You can manually go to the folder where mods.txt is located and review the mods, however, I have done this script since it is somehow more comfortable and the list is printed numbered and without the commas at the end. This script has also helped me improve my Python skills, since despite being a very simple script, I am still learning and this helps me not lose to practice.

DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------
You can use the code for personal purposes without any problem. You can also improve it, make a graphical interface with Tkinter, and much more. What I would like if you are going to distribute it would be a small mention, and of course not deleting the beginning of the code, which specifies who the creator of it is.
